Welcome to the code repository of the [Image Processing and Analysis for Life Scientists](https://www.edx.org/course/image-processing-and-analysis-for-life-scientists), [MOOC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_Open_Online_Course)  by the [BIOP](https://biop.epfl.ch/) team @EPFL.


Repository Content
===

In each folder, you will find a series of files with scripts. The scripts are heavily commented and are meant to be used interactively.

Each script, when run, will guide you through a concept in Image Processing and Analysis within Fiji. After you grasp the concepts introduced, look at the code and the comments to understand how the script works. 

This will introduce you to commonly used functions in the Macro language so that you can gain insight on how to code your own routines or adapt existing ones.

If you are not familiar with programming, the “Extra-Week” of the MOOC can help you, with videos and exercises to get you up to date with basic programming principles, vocabulary and how it is implemented in the ImageJ Macro Language.
